        I’m a programming enthusiast with a real drive to explore both web development and the bigger picture of tech security. I want to start from the ground up—getting hands-on with the basics like HTML and CSS—then work my way toward more advanced frameworks like React to create interactive, engaging user experiences. At the same time, I’m fascinated by the world of network security and cloud computing. The challenge of protecting information and ensuring safe online spaces really appeals to me, as does the power of cloud tech to transform how we handle and access data. I’m excited to grow my skills in both of these areas, aiming not just to learn but to eventually contribute meaningfully to digital innovation and security.
